1. `npx expo-doctor` to check if everything is alright, then `npx expo prebuild` to create/update the android folder.
2. Generate keystore file with:

```
keytool -genkey -v -keystore your_key_name.keystore -alias your_key_alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
```

3. Put the keystore file inside `android/app` folder.

```
release {
    storeFile file('your_key_name.keystore')
    storePassword 'password'
    keyAlias 'your_key_alias'
    keyPassword 'password'
}
```

5. Modify buildTypes â†’ release of `android/app/build.gradle` file to:

    signingConfig signingConfigs.release
    shrinkResources true
    minifyEnabled true
    proguardFiles getDefaultProguardFile("proguard-android.txt"), "proguard-rules.pro"
}
```

6. Add below code between signingConfigs and buildTypes:

```
splits {
    abi {
        reset()
        enable true
        universalApk true
        include "armeabi-v7a", "x86", "arm64-v8a", "x86-64"
